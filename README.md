### Site Owner Stories

The site owner wants a website that reflects the brand.  The owner is very passionate about their product and is very aware of the importance of having an online presence in todays market.  Initally the site owner wants to start out with a static website as a business and product portfolio but would be looking to upscale the website in the future to an ecommerce website.  The business is a new business and has a lovely range of products but as yet it has not got a strong brand identity.  The site owner is aware of this and feels that developing the website and getting advice on showcasing the business online is an opportunity to address this. The site owner wants the website to be vibrant and modern in style.

## Website Design

UX Design rationale will go here
The website will be developed using the mobile first principle.

### Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme I tested various colour combinations out.  I decided to go with 3 colours. One main colour and have both an analogus colour and a complimentary colour alongside it.  I think this suits the Pie Yeah brand personality - to fill in more here from my notes.  


### Typography

To reflect a modern and vibrant brand I decided that 'Comfortaa' and 'Montserrat' were suitable fonts.


### Wireframes

## Features

The site will have a home page, menu page and a contact page.
